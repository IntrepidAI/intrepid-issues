# Release Naming Convention

## Releases 0.x to 0.9
For versions leading up to 1.0, release names will consist of 2 words that succinctly summarize the content of that particular release. These names should provide a clear and concise indication of the major changes, features, or fixes introduced in the release.

Example:
- Release 0.1: "init-setup"
- Release 0.2: "hello-intrepid"
- Release 0.3: "feedback-buddy"

## Version 1.0 Onward
Starting from version 1.0 and beyond, release names will follow a theme that will be disclosed with the respective release notes. The theme might be inspired by project goals, code names, or any other relevant aspect. This approach aims to add a creative and cohesive element to the release naming process.

Developers and users can refer to the release notes for each version to understand the chosen theme and how it relates to the features and improvements introduced in that release.

Example:

- Release 1.5: "Harmony in Code" (theme: musical terms)
- Release 2.0: "Emerald Enigma" (theme: gemstones) 


Please refer to the release notes for more detailed information about each release, including specific changes and enhancements.
